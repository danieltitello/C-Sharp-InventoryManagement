# C-Sharp-Inventory Management System with SQL Server

This system was created to help the management of stock of assets and usb sticks returned at work. The program is created in C# and reads and writes data from/into the database.

The system has 4 screens:

1 - The main.cs screen has the login authentication that allows the users registered in the database to access the other functions;<br/>
2 - The UsbStick.cs screen reads and writes from/into the database the data related to the return of usb sticks;<br/>
3 - The Assets.cs screen reads and writes from/into the database the data related to assets(laptops/desktops);<br/>
4 - The AdvanceSearch.cs will help the user to search in the database using more complex filters and it will also allow the user to export the data to a excel file.
